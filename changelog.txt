1. Added changelog to keep track of all the changes I make
2. Removed the console.log from Events which appeared when you clicked clear
3. Added a new route so that all invalid routes redirect to HomePage
4. Removed eventId input from filters as I felt it was redundant
5. Added defer function to Events.js to handle load state 
6. Added About page
